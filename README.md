# SmolLMðŸ¤— Llama.cpp

SmolLM2, a family of three small language models, performs well in instruction following and reasoning. The largest model significantly improves over its predecessor through advanced training techniques.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `app.py`: The file containing the main gradio application.
- `logger.py`: The file containing the code for logging the application.
- `exception.py`: The file containing the code for custom exceptions used in the project.
- `requirements.txt`: The file containing the list of dependencies for the project.
- `LICENSE`: The license file for the project.
- `README.md`: The README file that contains information about the project.
- `assets`: The folder containing screenshots for working on the application.
- `.gitignore`: The file containing the list of files and directories to be ignored by Git.

## Tech Stack

- Python (for the programming language)
- Llama.cpp (llama-cpp-python as Python binding for llama.cpp)
- Hugging Face Hub (for the GGUF model)
- Gradio (for the main application)

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/sitamgithub-MSIT/SmolLM-llamacpp.git`
2. Change the directory: `cd SmolLM-llamacpp`
3. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv tutorial-env`
4. Activate the virtual environment: `tutorial-env\Scripts\activate`
5. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Run the Gradio application: `python app.py`

Now, you can open up your local host and see the web application running. For more information, please refer to the Gradio documentation [here](https://www.gradio.app/docs/interface). Also, a live version of the application can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/sitammeur/SmolLM-llamacpp).
